Apply solder paste in a quantity\nsufficient for reliable contact, yet restrained enough to avoid bridging, using a stencil, syringe, or similarly exacting tool. With\nthe paste in place, position the resistors deliberately—perhaps left to right—ensuring proper alignment before transferring\nthe assembly to a reflow environment. After successful reflow and cooling, repeat the same methodical procedure for three\n1206 LEDs—verifying polarity, preparing pads, applying paste, aligning, and reflowing—all executed with an attention to\ndetail verging on ritual. Finally, insert four two-pin headers, ensuring proper alignment with through-holes and avoiding\nangular stress.",
